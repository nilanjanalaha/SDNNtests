Description:  This package implements the methods discussed in Laha et al. (2020). In particular, this package performs nonparametric and shape-constrained (unimodality and log-concavity) test of one sided stochastic dominance against the null of non-dominance. This package also gives an estimator of the Hellinger distance between two densities under the shape  restriction of unimodality or log-concavity.
